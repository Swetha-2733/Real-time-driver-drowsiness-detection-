# Real-Time Driver Drowsiness Detection

This project is a **Real-Time Driver Drowsiness Detection** system that aims to improve road safety by detecting signs of drowsiness in drivers. Using computer vision and machine learning techniques, the system monitors the driver’s eye and facial movements to determine whether they are drowsy and alerts them in real-time.

## Introduction

Drowsy driving is a major cause of accidents on the road. This project leverages computer vision to monitor the driver’s eyes and detect when they are likely to be drowsy. By providing real-time alerts, it can potentially help prevent accidents and save lives.

## Features

- **Real-Time Eye and Face Monitoring**: Uses a webcam to continuously monitor the driver’s eyes and face.
- **Drowsiness Detection**: Analyzes eye aspect ratio and other facial cues to detect signs of drowsiness.
- **Alert System**: Provides real-time alerts (sound or visual) when drowsiness is detected.
- **Easy to Use**: Plug-and-play system that can work with any standard webcam.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Real-time-driver-drowsiness-detection.git
   cd Real-time-driver-drowsiness-detection
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure Python is installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Setup the Webcam**:
   Ensure a webcam is connected to your computer and accessible.

## Usage

1. **Run the Detection Script**:
   Use the following command to start the drowsiness detection:
   ```bash
   python driver.py
   ```

2. **Adjust Settings**:
   - You can customize detection sensitivity, such as the eye aspect ratio threshold, in the code to improve accuracy based on specific requirements.

3. **Real-Time Monitoring**:
   The system will display a live video feed. If drowsiness is detected, an alert will be triggered.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **OpenCV**: For video processing and real-time facial recognition.
- **Dlib**: For facial landmarks detection.
- **Numpy**: For numerical computations.
- **Scipy**: Used in signal processing to analyze the drowsiness levels.
  
## How It Works

The drowsiness detection system operates by:
1. **Detecting the Face and Eyes**: The system uses Dlib and OpenCV to detect facial landmarks, focusing on the eyes.
2. **Calculating Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)**: By analyzing the eye aspect ratio, it determines whether the eyes are closed.
3. **Analyzing Patterns**: If the EAR falls below a certain threshold for a sustained period, the system interprets this as a sign of drowsiness.
4. **Triggering an Alert**: When drowsiness is detected, an alert is activated to warn the driver.
